Command line utility (python script) to validate the quality of a Postman collection, workspace, or private API network.

## Purpose

This code demonstrates how to use the [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a) and the [Spectral CLI](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/9ffa04e052cc1-spectral-cli) to validate automatically the quality of a Postman collection, workspace, or private API network.

The script receives the Postman collection ID, workspace ID, or private network flag, downloads the respective data using the Postman API, and validates it against the specified rules.

### Errors

- The collection has a description
- All the requests have a description
- The request URL can’t be empty
- All the requests have an 2XX or 3XX example at least
- If the request contains path variables, it requires a 404 example
- All the examples have status code
- Delete examples status code must be 200 or 204
- If a request is authenticated, it should have a 401 example
- Requests query parameters require a description
- Requests path parameters require a description

### Warnings

- All the folders have a description
- The examples body format should be JSON
- HTTP is not allowed
- PATCH operations should have body
- No requests ending in “ Copy”

The file [rules.yaml](rules.yaml) contains all the previous rules. Some of them require custom Javascript functions, which are also included in the repository.

If any of the error rules doesn't pass for the resource being linted, the script returns an error status (1), which can be used in CI/CD processes to avoid further workflow steps.

> NOTE: You need a valid [Postman API key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/) to execute the command. You can save the API key in an environment variable called `POSTMAN_API_KEY`, and the script will read it from there.

```shell
export POSTMAN_API_KEY=PMAK_your_key
```

## Usage

The [linter.py](linter.py) command receives the following arguments:

```shell
python linter.py [-c <collectionId> | -w <workspaceId> | -p] -k [APIKey] -r [rulesFilePath]
```

| Argument      | Description                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| collectionId  | The id of the collection to lint.                                     |
| workspaceId   | The id of the workspace to lint.                                      |
| -p            | Flag to lint the private API network.                                 |
| APIKey        | Postman API key. Defaults to the environment variable POSTMAN_API_KEY |
| rulesFilePath | Path to rules file. Defaults to appropriate ruleset based on resource type |

> NOTE: The script saves the results of the linting operation (detailed errors and warnings) in a file called `_result.json`. You can use that file to build and send notifications. The script initially only uses it to calculate the error status and return it.
